## The Game

### Turns

In Checkers, the game starts with the Black player making the first move, followed by alternating turns between players. Each player moves their pieces diagonally forward, restricted to the dark squares on the board. A piece can typically only move one square at a time unless it's executing a jump move.

### Capturing

A player has the opportunity to capture an opponent's piece by executing a jump move, leaping over the opponent's piece and landing on an empty square on the opposite side. Each jump allows the player to capture only one piece, but they have the option to execute multiple jumps in a single turn if the arrangement of the pieces permits.

### Kings

Once a piece reaches the farthest row on the opposite side, it gains the status of a "king" in the game of Checkers. Kings possess the ability to move both forward and backward along the board, adding strategic depth to their movements.

### Eating

A player must eat or capture an opponent's man when the opposing man occupies the next square and there isn't any other man on the next square. If a player does capture an opponent's piece, they are forced to do another capture move if possible.
